# HCI Interaction Prototype – Axure RP

This project is a **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) interactive prototype** built using **Axure RP**. It demonstrates advanced gesture interactions (tap and swipe) between dynamic panels, focusing on smooth animation and user control feedback.

## 🧩 Features

- Tap on the **info panel** to:
  - Slide the panel up (200ms)
  - Move the image panel up by 100px (linear, 200ms)
  - Set selection state of the image panel to `true`

- Swipe down on the **image panel**:
  - Move it down by 100px (linear, 200ms)
  - Hide the info panel (slide down, 200ms)
  - Set selection state to `false`

- Swipe down on the **info panel**:
  - Triggers the `swipe down` event of the image panel via **Fire Event** interaction
